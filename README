Code for working with Binary Expression Trees.

Here's my algorithm for generating the expression, in nifty diagram form:

Generation of random expressions, evaluation of expressions for given variables, simplification of expressions, etc.

Some example expressions that were generated and then simplified (simplification is very much a WIP):

sin((-3.380515006246586 / (x * -6.972902091033304))) - x
(2 * (tan(x) - (((x ^ 6.5) ^ -7.39) ^ -7.1))) + x
(1 - x) * -1.97
(5 + ((x * -1.01) * -8.18)) - (cos((x + -0.6)) / x)
cos(((5 + cos(((x * 1.65) / x))) ^ (-1.31 ^ 4.12)))
